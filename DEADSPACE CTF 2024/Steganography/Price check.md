문제 설명 : <br>
DEADFACE가 마을 곳곳에서 무작위로 사람들을 해킹하고 있으며, 최근 피해를 본 곳은 Otto’s Grocery Store이다.<br>
이상하게도 피해는 회사의 네트워크가 아닌 고객들에게만 발생하고 있다.<br>
Otto’s Grocery Store는 이 공격을 파악하기 위해 우리한테 의뢰했으며, 우리는 게스트 WiFi를 통해 전송된 이상한 파일을 포착했다.<br>
이 파일이 주요 공격 경로라고 의심하고 있으며, 일부 피해자가 **무언가를 스캔했다**고 언급한 것을 들었다. 파일이 올바른 형식이 아닐 수도 있다는 추측이 있을 뿐이다.<br><br>

이 파일이 공격에 어떻게 사용되고 있는지 파악하여 플래그를 찾아내야 한다.<br><br>

문제 끝에 콤마를 넣고 길이를 줄 단위로 확인을 하니 29 * 29 크기의 사각형이 나오는 것을 확인할 수 있다.<br><br>
