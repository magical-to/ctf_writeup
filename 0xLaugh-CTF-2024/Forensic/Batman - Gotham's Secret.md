The description discusses recovering secrets from a stolen MacBook, specifically encrypted secret notes.

On macOS, notes are encrypted and stored in the Keychain. The Keychain database (login.keychain-db) is itself encrypted using the machine's password. Attempting to crack the Keychain password directly will not work because it is a complex password.

To retrieve the machine password, one can check if the user enabled Auto Login on macOS. If Auto Login is enabled [if /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist  exists, means auto login is enabled], Also com.apple.loginwindow.<GUID>.plist will contain application running when autologin (One of them is keychain XD), the password is stored in the /etc/kcpassword file [that file is created once you enable autologin]. This file is encrypted with a static XOR key:

7D 89 52 23 D2 BC DD EA A3 B9 1F

By decrypting the contents of the kcpassword file with this XOR key, the machine password can be obtained.

Once the machine password is recovered, it can be used to decrypt the login.keychain-db. Tools like Chainbreaker can assist in decrypting the Keychain database. By doing this, the encrypted note stored within the Keychain can be accessed and revealed.
